                            Bell Green is an area in south-east London, in the borough of Lewisham. 
                            Sandwiched between Forest Hill, Sydenham, Catford and Bellingham, partitioned 
                            by a river and railway line and a short walk away from the Borough of Bromley, 
                            It is a forgotten land, mostly taken up with a poorly planned retail Park, 
                            originally solely occupied by Sainbury's, before further development.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            The site of this retail park was once a gas works, generating and supplying gas 
                            for heating and lighting. So the land is reasonably toxic, though mostly locked 
                            away under the car parks and buildings. Any garden areas are 
                            sealed off and there are testing pipes dotted all around the area, for regular 
                            environmental sampling.
                        </p>

                            Because of the retail park, long established crossing point under 
                            the railway and relatively poor transport links, Bell Green suffers 
                            from large numbers of vehicle journeys, to and through the area, 
                            while pedestrians and cyclists have been sidelined, in favour of 
                            trying to keep the traffic flowing.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            All over London, retail parks are being converted to capitalise on the 
                            clamour for more homes to be built, with 'mixed use' regeneration being 
                            the preferred model. Considering redevelopment of the retail park is a 
                            likely outcome, the community need to be able to decide what sort of 
                            redevelopment they want and the area needs, creating a masterplan to guide 
                            future planning applications.

                            Like many urban places, Bell Green has a littering problem. Litter 
                            had been allowed to build up in public and private places and it 
                            often appeared that it was not shifting for extended periods of 
                            time. A glance under bushes or nehind utility boxes revealed years of 
                            historic litter, out of sight, but present.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            In 2013, we started picking up litter on our journey to and from school, 
                            collecting bags of litter a day from the pavements and gutters. If we saw 
                            flytipping, it was reported tot he council for quick removal. We also 
                            started tackling really bad areas, getting into bushes, housing 
                            estates, privately owned land and public areas that were showing 
                            signs of real neglect. Gradually we started to clear the historic litter, 
                            whilst also keeping the pavements cleared daily.
                        </p>

                    </div>

                    
                </div>

                <div class="home-container">
                    <div class="home-box" id="home-text-2">
                        <p>
                            What we have noticed, after over a year of action, is that littering seems to 
                            have dramatically reduced and the area has changed from one of gathering 
                            litter, into one where the pavements and green spaces are often virtually 
                            litter free. Spaces behind walls and bushes where bottles and cans were 
                            regularly dumped are often completely clear. The main problems now are 
                            on private land, animal attacks on street bins and council estate communal bins.

                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            The ultimate aim is not to have to pick up litter at all. We all pay council tax 
                            and our local authority and businesses have duties to tackle littering. Changes 
                            need to come. New bins, better street cleaning, improved waste management and action 
                            to bring business on board to maintain the land around their premises. But until then, 
                            repeatedly tackling the litter is the main strategy.

                            Bell Green is an area which is partially locked in. Just to the east is a 
                            railway line running north to south, and there are very few crossing points 
                            available for road traffic, pedestrians and cyclists. Bell Green hosts one of 
                            them. Understandably, this means Bell Green sees a great deal more traffic than 
                            other areas, as it is concentrated through the pinch point under the railway line.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            This pinch point is very narrow, providing room for two lanes of traffic and only one 
                            narrow pavement. It is also low, to the point that it cannot be used by double decker 
                            buses.
