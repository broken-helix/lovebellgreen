                        <h2>Who or what is 'Love Bell Green'?</h2>

                        <p>
                            In physical terms, 'Love Bell Green' is a family who are trying to make their area a nicer place to be.
                            But it is also a vision of a place where people can form a community, take pleasure in their surroundings 
                            and be proud of where they live.
                        </p

                        <p>
                            My name is James and I can often be found wandering the streets with a litter-picker and a blue bag, 
                            or taking photos of dumped bags, bits of furniture and overflowing bins on the streets.  I often have 
                            my two children with me, particularly on the way to and from school.  And I'm not usually wandering.  I'm 
                            just going somewhere.  With a litterpicker.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I've been getting hacked off about the way things are since I started having to push a child around in 
                            a pushchair.  This really opens your eyes.  The badly parked cars, the traffic, the crossings, the obstructions...  
                            So... you complain.  When I had to walk around that car parked over the pavement or across a dropover again, 
                            while trying to get my kid to nursery, I started taking photos and reporting the problem.  The effect was underwhelming, to say the least.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The council (Lewisham) appear to be a bit rubbish at taking action or communicating.  Nothing seems 
                            to change.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I got involved with meetings about our pair of Gas Holders, which the council both locally listed the Gas Holders 
                            and then practically gave the green light for demolition.  I got involved with the meetings which spawned 
                            an attempt at gaining Neighbourhood Forum status, which the council rejected.  So I decided to do something myself.  
                            In another space, I've been photographing construction projects for over 8 years, watching areas get 'regenerated'.  
                            I've seen good things and awful things and I can see a vision of Bell Green beyond Warehouse Retail and Car Parks.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The war on litter has been going on since February 2023, when we bought a litterpicker for our son 
                            for his birthday.  There wasn't a lot of thought about it.  It's hard thinking up present ideas!  
                            So, in the evening, we went out to try out the litterpicker.  We're located halfway along our road.  
                            It's not a long road. 60 houses?  We only went to the end and filled a whole kitchen liner bag!

                What is Lorem Ipsum?
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).


Where does it come from?
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
